## D-001 — 2026-06 — Tech stack
Decision: Next.js (TypeScript) + Supabase (Postgres + Auth) + Vercel;
planning brain = Claude API server-side; scoring engine isolated as its
own tested module.
Why: one language and one deploy = fewest moving parts for a solo
non-dev; the stack Claude Code is strongest at; scales from portfolio
demo to real users without a rewrite (Supabase auth = multi-user built in).
Alternatives rejected: Python backend + JS frontend (two stacks to
maintain); mobile-first v1 (web decided).
